Still in development.
We are happy to introduce you to our Console-Based BlackJack game.
Thanks to it you can easily satisfy your gambling habit without losing money.

How to play:
It's simple, you start with 1000 chips, imagine they are a thousand bucks.
Dealer gets a card from the deck, standard card deck.
You also get a card, each card has a value between 1 and 11.
You decide whether you draw another card from the deck or to stand with the ones you have.
If you have 21, you get a BlackJack and you win 2.5 your bet, if you go over 21 you bust and lose.
If you win with lower than 21 you win 2.0 your bet.
After your draw, dealer decides whether he should hit or stand. The same rules apply for him.
If he goes over 21, he busts, if he has 21, it's a BlackJack.
When you ran out of chips and they become 0, you will be asked to start a new game or quit.
Exiting the game creates a save game file, that contains the last amount of chips you had,
and a simple statistic for the won,lost and tied games you had. The save game loads up
every time you launch the game.
